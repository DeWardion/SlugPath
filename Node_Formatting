// This file attempts to convey the formatting used for data representation used for reading information when calculating shortest paths between nodes for SlugPath. 
// The format is as follows: 
// <node #>, <node name>, <node area> <latitude>, <longitude>, <node type, additional node type, additional node type, ...>;
// 
// Node ID will always be six digits: the first pair denote the area, the second pair denote a non-map node, and the last three indicate a map node. 
// Node area defines the proximity in which the node is located
// Node types include: acad, coll, mark, dine, ftgo, resd, actv, stsr, othr
// Node types indicate academic structures, colleges, markets, dining halls, food to go (cafes, etc.), residences, activity centers, and student services.
